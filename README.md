# Read English Aloud

_This is a simple project that I carried out while learning **Ionic 3** through a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/learn-ionic-3-from-scratch/)._

In Brazil, I have seen many Brazilian people who can handle some written English, but have a hard time when it comes to speaking. My idea was to create an Ionic app that would help such people understand some relation you may identify between written and spoken English.

I published an alpha version on Google Play and now I wonder if I could make the app a bit better. If you are a developer and cares about English for foreigners, and you would like to contribute with my simple app, please feel free to join me.
